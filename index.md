# In-browser presentation

# Writing your presentation?

    # Title of awesome presentation

    This is slide 1 of your presentation. But you want more
    slides, don't you? Easy! Just look:

    ***

    # Slide 2!

    That indeed was easy, right?

Put that in a file named `slides.md`, open up your console:

    $ speecher slides.md slides.html

And open your browser. JavaScript libraries are bundled in `js/`.

But those cute steps? Continue to find out!

# Adding interactivity (eh, steps)

Simply insert a placeholder! Remember the list I showed before?

    * This is your first step ! STEP
    * Let's add another .. ! STEP
    * And a third! ! STEP

(Remove the space between ! and STEP. I should fix this.)

That's all there is to it. 

***

# Controlling your presentation

* Proceed to next step/slide: mouse click or right arrow key
* Go backwards: left arrow key

Next slide will have some links for you.
